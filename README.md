A simple local file server application built with Python, Flask, and CustomTkinter GUI. It allows you to serve files from a chosen directory on your local network, control the server via a graphical interface, monitor connections, and block unwanted IP addresses.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Serve Files:** Host files over HTTP from any specified directory.
* **GUI Control:** Start and stop the Flask server directly from the intuitive CustomTkinter GUI.
* **Change Directory:** Easily change the directory being served via the GUI.
* **Web Interface:** Clients can browse and download files via a simple web page.
* **Connection Logging:** Log the IP addresses of clients who access the server (since the server was last started by the GUI).
* **IP Blocking:** Block specific IP addresses from accessing the server directly from the GUI. Blocked IPs are saved persistently.
* **Network Monitoring:** View system-wide network send/receive traffic in the GUI.
* **Server Log Output:** See the raw output (stdout/stderr) from the Flask server process within the GUI.
* **Remember Last Folder:** The application remembers the last served folder when you reopen the GUI.
* **Basic Security:** Implements path traversal protection to prevent clients from accessing files outside the served directory.
